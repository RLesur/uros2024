## From innovators to early majority

::: incremental

- **~2000-2008**: innovators
- **2008-2013**: first trainings given by innovators to early adopters
- **2013**: the use of R officially recognized internally
- **2013-2022**: a collective skills upgrade
  * a lot of trainings, [documentation](https://www.utilitr.org/)...
  * some successes: packages released on CRAN; all open source languages officially recognized in 2018
  * some issues: managing R in IT environments for 1500 statisticians

:::

## From early majority to full adoption

::: incremental

- **2022**: decision to use only open source languages from 2026 onwards
  * 50% of the statistical programs already been rewritten in R
  * new IT environment for statisticians and data scientists based on [Onyxia](https://onyxia.sh)
- **2022-2026**:
  * trainings for late majority and laggards
  * rewriting of the remaining codes

## Take away messages

- Statisticians are (citizen) developers and must be trained as developers
- Middle management must also be trained
- Statisticians must become IT best friends
