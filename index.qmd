## A journey to R adoption in an NSI

R adoption at INSEE (France): 1500 statisticians

## Innovators' motivators

::: incremental

- **~2000-2012** Innovators' motivators:
  * graphical capabilities (`lattice`)
  * literate programming (`Sweave()`)
  * spatial data analysis (`sp`)

:::

## From Innovators to Early Adopters

::: incremental

- **2012**:
  * first R user group in Paris ([FL\\tauR](https://fltaur.wordpress.com/))
  * the use of R officially recognized internally
  * first RStudio server
- **2012-2018** Early adopters' motivators
  * RStudio IDE
  * graphical capabilities (`ggplot2`)
  * literate programming (`knitr`, `rmarkdown`)
  * dataviz web applications (`shiny`)
  * data wrangling (`tidyverse`, `data.table`)
  * first packages released on CRAN (`icarus`, `btb`, `gustave`)
:::

## Getting the Early Majority

::: incremental

- **2018**: all open source languages officially recognized
- **2018-2022**: a collective skills upgrade
  * mass trainings in R
  * an open source, community-based documentation on R by and for INSEE statisticians: [utilitR](https://www.utilitr.org/)...
  * adoption of an internal open source code publication policy
  * prototyping a new working environment for data science: an open source cloud based datalab ([Onyxia](https://onyxia.sh))

:::

## Moving away from proprietary languages

::: incremental

- **2022**: 
  * 50% of the statistical scripts already been rewritten in R (voluntary initiatives)
  * decision to use only open source languages from 2026 onwards (motivated by the increase in licensing costs)
  * new internal environment for statisticians and data scientists based on [Onyxia](https://onyxia.sh) (vendor lock-ins have moved from languages to platforms)
  * `parquet` files to store and disseminate data (preference for a cross language file format)

:::

## From early majority to full adoption

::: incremental

- **2022-2026**:
  * mass trainings for late majority and laggards
  * new trainings on [Best Practices with R](https://inseefrlab.github.io/formation-bonnes-pratiques-git-R/), [Bringing Data Science Projects into Production](https://ensae-reproductibilite.github.io/website/)
  * an active community helping each other
  * rewriting of the remaining codes (thanks to ChatGPT for helping us understand SAS programs)

## The main challenge we faced

. . .

### Lack of alignment between IT and statisticians

::: incremental

- IT teams are risk averse: they are paid to provide **stable** IT environments
- providing a working environment for R and python users is challenging: open source languages are **unstable** by nature
- R/python users need flexibility/IT need stability  
  **Can we find a way out?**

## Tips for dealing with IT

Dean Marchiori's post: ["_5 tips for dealing with IT_"](https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-11-18-dealing-with-it/):

::: incremental

- **Have empathy**: understand them and what they're facing
- **Political alignment**: convince your manager to help you with IT
- **Find supporters in IT**
- **Find (safe) workaround**: there is always a grey area between what is allowed and what is not 
- **Buy commercially licensed software**

- **Find (safe) workaround**: there is always a grey area between what is allowed and what is not 
- **~~Buy commercially licensed software~~** **[not always necessary]{.orange}** 

## How did we align IT and statisticians?

::: incremental

- Political alignment: creation of an innovation team in the IT Department
- Mutual empathy
- Statisticians' most valuable supporters
- Create workarounds for statisticians: [sspcloud.fr](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr)

## Towards a new deal between IT and statisticians

An official statistical office is a socio-technical system. We need:

- people (business matter, methods, IT)
- data
- hardware
- software
- law and regulations

## The technology that opened us new horizons

![](img/containers.jpg){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

## The benefits of containers

::: incremental

- from the outside, they are all identical: IT teams can learn to manage them routinely
- inside, you can put whatever you like (any R version, R packages, system dependencies...)
- containers are now the basis of all data platforms: IT in official statistics offices **must** learn to deal with them
- containers also used in DevOps platforms

:::

## A new deal between IT and statisticians

::: incremental

- IT cares about containers orchestration and possible vulnerabilities inside them
- IT offers a flexible container based platform (many versions of R, IDEs...) and offers support
- IT recognizes statisticians as "citizen developers"
- Statisticians may receive the power to customize containers (add/remove pieces of software)

## The modern statistician: a proposal

- Uses open source languages
- Adopts best practices for software development (version control, modular code, tests)
- Manages the dependencies of her projects: packages and system dependencies (`renv`, `pak`, `rix`...)
- Has the right to build a docker image (linux 101)
- Has the right to orchestrate workflows and deploy applications in production (CI/CD)

> If this is too much for statisticians, we may need to integrate IT engineers into the business/methods units

## The challenges we are facing

::: incremental

- A wall of confusion between statisticians:
  *  some statisticians (mostly managers) saw R a new statistical "tool". They focus on the product, not the process.
  * other statisticians (mostly the younger ones) saw R as a programming language and considered themselves as developers. They care about the process
- Statistical training lacks solid basis in computer science:
  * Academics have become too specialized
  * Few academics also have a production experience
:::

## Take away messages

- Statisticians are (citizen) developers and must be trained as developers
- Middle management must also be trained
- Statisticians must become IT best friends
