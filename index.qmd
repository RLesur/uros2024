## From innovators to early majority

::: incremental

- **~2000-2008**: innovators
- **2008-2013**: first trainings given by innovators to early adopters
- **2013**: the use of R officially recognized internally
- **2013-2022**: a collective skills upgrade
  * a lot of trainings, [documentation](https://www.utilitr.org/)...
  * some successes: packages released on CRAN; all open source languages officially recognized in 2018
  * some issues: managing R in IT environments for 1500 statisticians

:::

## From early majority to full adoption

::: incremental

- **2022**: decision to use only open source languages from 2026 onwards
  * 50% of the statistical programs already been rewritten in R
  * new IT environment for statisticians and data scientists based on [Onyxia](https://onyxia.sh)
- **2022-2026**:
  * trainings for late majority and laggards
  * rewriting of the remaining codes

## The challenge we faced

**Lack of alignment between IT and R users**

. . .

[Dean Marchiori](https://www.deanmarchiori.com/)'s post ["_5 tips for dealing with IT_"](https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-11-18-dealing-with-it/):

. . .

- **IT teams are risk averse**, they want to manage risks
- Dean's tips:

  * **Have empathy**: understand them and what they're facing
  * **Political alignment**: convince your manager to help you with IT
  * **Find supporters in IT**
  * **Find (safe) workaround**
  * **Buy commercially licensed software**

## The challenge we faced

**Lack of alignment between IT and R users**

. . .

How did we solve it?

. . .

**Political alignment**: creation of an innovation team in the IT Department

- Empathy for statisticians
- Most valuable supporters
- Propose workarounds for statisticians: [sspcloud.fr](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr) 

## The challenges we are facing

A wall of confusion between statisticians:

. . .

**The nature of R**

::: incremental

- some statisticians (mostly managers) saw R a new statistical "tool"
- younger statisticians saw R as a programming language and considered themselves as developers

:::

## Take away messages

- Statisticians are (citizen) developers and must be trained as developers
- Middle management must also be trained
- Statisticians must become IT best friends
